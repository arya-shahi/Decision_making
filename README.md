# Decision_making
### Experiment 5

**Aim -**
To do decision making using If-else.

**Theory**
Decision-making in programming allows for executing different code paths based on specific conditions. In C++, the `if` and `else` statements are essential constructs for implementing conditional logic and controlling the flow of execution. It is used to evaluate certain conditions in the program 


**Conclusion**
In this experiment we learned about using If-else
